This can be useful in various applications, such as object recognition, medical imaging, and remote sensing.\nRecommendation Systems: Clustering can be used to group similar items or products based on customer preferences, ratings, or purchase history. This information can then be used to recommend products or services to customers who are likely to be interested in them.\nGenomic Analysis: Clustering techniques are widely used in bioinformatics to group genes or proteins based on their expression patterns or other characteristics. This can help researchers identify genes or proteins that are involved in specific biological processes or diseases, and develop targeted therapies or treatments.\nExamples Of Linear Regression in Real Life Sales Forecasting: Linear Regression is widely used in business to predict future sales based on historical data. It helps companies to plan inventory and resources, make informed decisions, and avoid overstocking or understocking.\nMedical Research: Linear Regression is used to study the relationship between two or more variables in medical research. For example, it can be used to analyze the effect of a particular drug on a disease or the impact of lifestyle changes on health outcomes.\nReal Estate: Linear Regression is used to predict the price of a property based on its characteristics, such as location, size, number of rooms, and other amenities. This information can be used by buyers and sellers to make informed decisions about buying and selling properties.\nWeather Forecasting: Linear Regression is used in weather forecasting to predict temperature, humidity, precipitation, and other weather variables. It helps weather forecasters to provide accurate and timely information to the public and help them make informed decisions.\nWorking With Images import cv2 from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow from google.colab import drive # mount gDrive in VM drive.mount('/gdrive') # downloading the image to the desired path in gDrive !curl -o /gdrive/MyDrive/SDU/test/flower-2.jpg https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/resources/images/flower-2.jpg # load and display the image: image = cv2.imread(\"/gdrive/MyDrive/SDU/test/flower-2.jpg\") cv2_imshow(image) # image height, width and depth: v, s, d = image.shape print(f\"Image height, width and depth: {image.shape}\") # get pixels: px = image[150, 130] print(f\"Retrieved pixels: {px}\") # blue, green and red - RGB mode image[150, 130] = image[0, 0, 0] image[100:115, 100:110] = [0, 255, 255] # cv2_imshow(image) # resizing the image and converting the image to grayscale image_new = image image_new = cv2.resize(image_new, (int(s*2), int(v/3))) image_new = cv2.cvtColor(image_new, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) print(f\"Height, width and depth of new image: {image_new.shape}\") cv2_imshow(image_new) K-means And Images Displaying picture segmented into 3 images by 3 clusters:\n# K-means for original image # defining model: (we want to show picture in 3 colors and that's why we use 3 clusters): kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42, n_init=\"auto\") # model training: data = image.reshape(-1, 3) kmeans.fit(data) print(f\"Coordinates of centroids: \\n{kmeans.cluster_centers_}\") # show coordinates of centroids segmentedImage = kmeans.cluster_centers_[ kmeans.labels_] # for display, picture need to be in int or float from 0 to 1 segmentedImage = segmentedImage / 255 # converting to float (first way) # segmentedImage = segmentedImage.astype(int) # converting to int (seconde-way) imageInColor = segmentedImage.reshape(image.shape) # reeshape image to image.shape like we are previous do plt.imshow(imageInColor) Multivariat Linear Regression Reidual and using 150 of data, and predicting for 11th house and calculating residual.\nfrom sklearn import datasets import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression # for linear regression from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error # for mean squared error # save dataset into variable dataset = datasets.fetch_openml('house_sales', version = 3) print(dataset.keys()) print(dataset.feature_names) print(dataset.target_names) # we are using dataset from fetch_openml so we need to convert it from pandas to numpy data = np.array(dataset.data) price = np.array(dataset.target[:150]) # dependend number_bedrooms = data[:150, 0] # independend number_bathrooms = data[:150, 1] # independend number_sqft_living = data[:150, 2] # independend number_sqft_lot = data[:150, 3] # independend X = np.array([number_bedrooms, number_bathrooms, number_sqft_living, number_sqft_lot]).T y = price lin_reg = LinearRegression().fit(X, y) # train model of linear regression # make predictions using the testing set y_pred = lin_reg.predict(X) print(f\"Score for linear regression: {lin_reg.score(X, y)}\") # predicting for data on index 20 price_11 = (y[11]) # 20 is presenting 21 person got_price = round(y_pred[11], 2) #round to 2 decimals residual_11 = round(abs(price_11 - got_price), 2) print(f\"Residual is: {residual_11}.\") Linear Regression coefficient, predicting for 11th house price and calculating residual, but here is used whole dataset.
